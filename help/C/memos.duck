= Memos and the calendar
  [topic]
@link[guide >index]

The star at the top of every day can be used for memos. It turns orange, if a memo for this day exists.
If you have to add a lot of appointments at once, the calendar view is useful. Here you can also edit the memos, which
appear in the timetable view.
