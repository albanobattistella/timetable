= Exceptions, replacement lessons, shifting lessons
  [topic]
@link[guide >index]

Temporary class entries are created by a classname, which is prepended by a dot. An example for a temporary class entry is ".9c".
Dot-enties are used for shifting and replacement lessons. They are not repeated and do not affect repetition of the original entry.

If a lesson is simply cancelled, use only a dot (".") as class entry.

Dot-entries are also printed in red.
