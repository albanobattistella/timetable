= Exceptions, substitute lessons, shifting lessons

@link[guide >index]

Temporary class entries are created by a classname, which is preceeded by a dot. No leading spaces are allowed. An example for a temporary class entry is ".9c".
Dot enties are used for shifting and substitute lessons. They are not repeated and do not affect repetition of the original entry.

If a lesson is simply cancelled, use only a dot (".") as class entry.

Dot entries are also shown in red.
