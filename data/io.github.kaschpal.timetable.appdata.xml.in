    <p>
      Timetable imitates a classical calendar/planner for teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The topic of the lesson is assigned by the sequence. If you shift the lesson, i.e. by adding a replacement lesson, the topic is moved automatically by the order of the sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sequence view, you can edit the topic and the chronological order. Every line is one topic. The list of sequences is an ordinary text field, which means, you can copy and paste to or from a textfile. The classes in the sequence view are created dynamically. You don&apos;t have to keep a list of your classes in the settings.
